# Tennis Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing tennis matches using computer vision techniques. It leverages OpenCV and custom implementations to track player movement, detect the ball, and visualize court elements on video frames. The analysis aims to provide insights into player positioning, shot accuracy, and match dynamics.

## Features
- **Player Tracking:** Detect and track players on the court using computer vision.
- **Ball Detection:** Identify and follow the ball during play.
- **Court Visualization:** Overlay court boundaries and key areas for better analysis.
- **Distance Measurement:** Calculate distances between players and other elements.
- **Frame-by-Frame Processing:** Analyze each frame individually for precise insights.

## Implementation Details
- Utilizes OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction.
- Custom algorithms for object tracking and distance measurement.
- Court boundaries are mapped using geometric transformations.
- Data from frames is processed to generate analytical insights.

## Example Output
Below is a sample visualization from the analysis:

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning for more accurate player and ball detection.
- Enhance court element recognition using homography.
- Improve visualization with real-time overlays.
